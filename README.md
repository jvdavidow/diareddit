the Diabetes Mapping Project

This application allows users to signup and post anonymyzed versions of their diabetes treatment management logs.  These logs can be uploaded and attached to their account to be compiled over time, focusing on five major variables, in order of importance to the project:

1.  Glucose Readings (Blood or CGM)
2.  Carbohydrate Intake
3.  Insulin Units taken
4.  Exercise Outputs
5.  Stress Levels

A feature of the application will additionally allow anonymized users to interact with other users, seeking qualitative posts about their experience managing their treatment.

Optional user stats will be requested but not required, including, but not limited to, age, gender, age at diagnosis, history of treatment, co-morbidities, what meds they are prescribed, any technologies or therapeutics used, and their general regemin as prescribed by their care provider.

The application will include:

* a signup page
* an upload page
* a profile page
* a community forum (including a best of challenge)
* an about/contact page
